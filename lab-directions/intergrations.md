# In this lab we will configure the intergrations for the e-commerce application 

Let's start by taking down any running version of the app

`cd ~/docker/ecommerce-workshop/deploy`

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-agent.yml down`

Let's copy the docker-compse file so we can continue in a new file

`cp docker-compose-agent.yml docker-compose-int.yml`
