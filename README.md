# Commands with explainations

`docker-compose`
For the sake of these labs docker-compose command will launch/destroy our web-store application based on a series of switches.

`docker-compse -f file-name.yaml up -d`
The above command will create resources based on the file named faile-name.yaml and will run the containers in the background and will leave them running for when we take breaks.

`docker-compse -f file-name.yaml down`
The above command tears down the containers based on the file name listed above.
